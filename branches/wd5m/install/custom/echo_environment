# This file is the EchoLinux ENVIRONMENT file. It is designed to set a list of global varaibles
# which are used by the software.
#
# These environment variables could have set in the IRLP EVIRONMENT file. Our concept
# was to keep the two systems as seperate as possible to allow for easy removal of EchoLinux.
# Please make sure that you read and understand the installation instrcutions.

# <My Call>
# This variable contains the callsign of the local EchoIRLP system as known
# by the EchoLink network
export ECHO_MYCALL=VK2XYZ-L

# <Say Node Number>
# This variable determines if the node number is spoken after the standard 
# Connect to EchoLink message is played.
export ECHO_SAY_NODE=CALLSIGN

# <Use EchoLink Servers>
# The following variable determines if you will use the EchoLink Status servers or
# a hosts file for IP address resolution.  Please make sure to read the installation
# instructions for complete details on the use of host files and EchoLink servers.  
export ECHO_SERVERS=NO

# <Seclect EchoLink Server>
# Set this variable for the EchoLink Status server desired
# This is not used if you selected ECHO_HOSTS=YES
# Uncomment the desired server
#export ECHO_SERVER=oceania.echolink.org
export ECHO_SERVER=naeast.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=nasouth.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=server.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=backup.echolink.org
