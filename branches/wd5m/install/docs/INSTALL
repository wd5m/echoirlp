Installation

Ugly, I know... :-)

First, decide if you want to run in shared conference or tbd mode.  If 
using tbd, install thebridge first and configure using the sample tbd.conf
in the EchoIRLP files area as a template.

Edit the IRLP environment file and add the following lines 
(if not already there)

export ECHO_MYCALL=MYCALL-R # Echolink callsign
export ECHO_SAY_NODE=CALLSIGN
export ECHO_SERVERS=YES
# This is not used if you selected ECHO_HOSTS=YES
export ECHO_SERVER=oceania.echolink.org # select closest to you
#export ECHO_SERVER=naeast.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=nasouth.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=server.echolink.org
#export ECHO_SERVER=backup.echolink.org
export ECHOLINUX=/home/irlp/custom/EchoIRLP
export ECHO_BIN=$ECHOLINUX/bin
export ECHO_SCRIPT=$ECHOLINUX/scripts
export ECHO_AUDIO=$ECHOLINUX/audio
export ECHO_NODE_DESC="My EchoIRLP node" 
export ECHO_ENV=TRUE

If you're going to run tbd, add the following lines as well.
export ECHO_TBD=/home/irlp/tbd # must match tbd's home directory
export ECHO_TBD_DATA=/home/irlp/tbd/data # where tbd keeps its data files
export ECHO_TBD_ENABLE=YES 
export ECHO_TBD_HOST=127.0.0.1
export ECHO_TBD_LISTEN=2174   # must match entry in tbd.conf
export ECHO_TBD_SEND=2074  # must match entry in tbd.conf
export ECHO_TBD_PASSWD="secret"  # must match RTP_Pass in tbd.conf
export ECHO_TBD_COMMAND="/usr/local/bin/tbdcmd" 

If using shared conference mode and want to use the EchoLink servers 
to resolve conference addresses, you also need to edit the userdata.txt
file in the EchoIRLP directory and copy it to 
/home/irlp/.echoLinux/userdata.txt

If using the Echo_idle feature, you need to make further changes to your 
IRLP node configuration as per the CHANGES file.
